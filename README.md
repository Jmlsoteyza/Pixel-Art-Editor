# Pixel-Art-Editor


As a Front-end Developer, I have created a website that features a Pixel-Art-Editor. This online tool allows users to create pixel art, a graphic aesthetic that originated from 8 and 16-bit computers.

Pixel art involves creating images at the pixel level, resulting in a distinctive retro look that has gained popularity in recent years. With my Pixel-Art-Editor website, users can easily create their own pixel art designs, choosing from a wide range of colors and editing tools.

I always have been a passion about the technology of Pixel-Art-Editor where I really wanted to create an art in pixel art editor which is why the reason I've built it.
