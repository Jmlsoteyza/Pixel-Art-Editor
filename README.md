# Pixel-Art-Editor


As a front-end developer, I have created a website that features a pixel-art editor. This online tool allows users to create pixel art, a graphic aesthetic that originated from 8- and 16-bit computers.

Pixel art involves creating images at the pixel level, resulting in a distinctive retro look that has gained popularity in recent years. With my Pixel-Art-Editor website, users can easily create their own pixel art designs, choosing from a wide range of colors and editing tools.

I've always been passionate about the intersection of technology and art, and specifically about the unique medium of pixel art. That's why I set out to create a pixel art editor
